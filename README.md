# Paint-Calculations-in-Java

Users can input project details such as the project's title, budget, dimensions of the walls (height, width, and length), and the price of a can of paint. The program calculates and displays the total wall area, the amount of paint needed, the number of cans required for up to three coats of paint, the cost for each coating scenario, and how each scenario fits within the user's budget. This tool is aimed at helping users efficiently plan their painting projects by estimating costs and required materials.
